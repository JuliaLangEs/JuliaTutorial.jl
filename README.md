This is a Julia based tutorial covering the following topics:

* Introduction to Linear Algebra
* Applications of Matrix Factorizations
* Introduction to Text Mining 
* Introduction to Recommender Systems

This package has each of the above mentioned topics as sub-modules. However as of now only Text Mining tutorial is available, and the rest are under way. 

# Installation
This is an unregistered package, and can be installed in the following two ways:
