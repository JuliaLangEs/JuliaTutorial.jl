Only later did I realize what makes Julia different from all the others. Julia breaks down the second wall — the wall
between your high-level code and native assembly. Not only can you write code with the performance of C in Julia,
you can take a peek behind the curtain of any function into its LLVM Intermediate Representation as well as its
generated assembly code — all within the REPL. Check it out.
