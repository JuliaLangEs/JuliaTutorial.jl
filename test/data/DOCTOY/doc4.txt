Homoiconicity — the code can be operated on by other parts of the code. Again, R kind of has this too! Kind of,
because I’m unaware of a good explanation for how to use it productively, and R’s syntax and scoping rules make it
tricky to pull off. But I’m still excited to see it in Julia, because I’ve heard good things about macros and I’d like to
appreciate them.
